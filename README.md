# Univeristy Progression System

- Developed a student progression classification tool in Python to evaluate academic outcomes based on user input of credits earned.
- Implemented robust input validation to ensure user inputs are within an accepted range and are valid integers, enhancing the reliability of the program.
- Designed a function to categorize academic progression into distinct outcomes: "Progress," "Module Trailer," "Do not Progress - Module Retriever," and "Exclude," based on predefined criteria.
- Created a looped user interaction system to allow multiple sets of data entry, providing users with the option to quit and view results or continue with new entries.
- Programmed a summary histogram output to display the number of students falling into each academic progression category after input completion.
- Applied exception handling to manage invalid inputs gracefully and provide user-friendly feedback, improving the user experience and program robustness.
